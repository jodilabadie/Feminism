<h1 class="one"> Here are six ways that you can be a women's right advocate. </h1>

    <ol>
         <li>Raise your voice </li>
         <p>Whether you are talking to your friends or family, or advocacy organization, the
            most important way to advocate is to speak up. You can spread awareness
            and break barriers.</p>
         <li>Support one another</li>
         <p>Supporting women and those that empower women, is essential to achieving
            gender equality. It can be as simple as you supporting women entrepreneurs
            in your community, you can make a difference</p>
          <li>Educate the next generation</li>
          <p>Youth activists around the world are stepping it up for gender equality.
             By empowering young advocates, and educating them about women's rights,
             we can ensure a better future for all.</p>
             <img align="right" src="giphy.gif">
          <li>Know your rights</li>
          <p>By knowing your rights as a woman you are ensuring that these rights
               are not taken away from you or being ignored by society.</p>
          <li>Join the conversation</li>
          <p>In 2017, we saw the power of social media campaigns in changing attitudes and
             raising awareness. By sharing your stories and amplifying the voices of
             others who do, you can make a difference.</p>
          <li>Give to the cause</li>
          <p>Every woman and girl deserves the opportunity to live a life free from
             violence and discrimination. Your donation can help so many people.</p>
