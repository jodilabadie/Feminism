     <h2 class= "two"> What is the Feminism Movement</h2>

     <p> Feminism is the movement created to advocated for women's rights on the basis
         of the equality of the sexes. Contrary to popular beliefs the feminism movement was not created to
         belittle men or make woman superior. It was simply made to fight for gender equality.
         For years women have worked the same jobs that men work and have received
         less pay than men.They dont receive less because they dont work as well men, they
         receive less simply because they're women.Imagine working the same hours, working just as hard and being just as committed
         to your job as someone else but receiving less money because society does not
         respect and they believe that men deserve more than you do. The focus of this movement is to fight
         to ensure that women and men are seen as equals. To ensure that women are respected the same way men are. To
         ensure that women receiive the same opportunities as men when they deserve it.</p>

<h3> Here are some inequalities faced by women </h3>

    <li>Women are more likely to be sexualized</li>
 </ol>
