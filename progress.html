  <h1 class="one"> What progress has the movement made over the years? </h1>

  <p>The feminism movement has been advocating for equality for many years.The Movement
     has been making lots of progress.Before women were not offered the same opportunities
     as men in terms of jobs an education. For the longest while women were not allowed to go
     to school or even to work. They were supposed to stay home and cook, clean and take
     care of the kids. For the longest while women were the most disrespected. Due to
     the generations before us fighting for our rightts we can now say that there has been a lot
     of change.</p>
